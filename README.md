# Web Developer Example
Convert the website design into a functioning website using HTML best practices.
* Design is located in the "Design" folder.
* Image assets are available in the "img" folder.
* Links do not need to be functional or link anywhere.
* Use of external libraries like Bootstrap is acceptable
* Make responive on different size screens/devices

## Notes 

### Features I wasn't to implement as properly as Intended

* The site itself is a little off center, resulting in difficulty in both correcting and difficulty for proper resizing on smaller screensizes

* Resizability could be much better if given more time. My first attempt was to mimic the given photo and refactor to have resizability. 
  * I found that was a mistake on my part that I wish I focused more on from the start with bootstrap.
* The hamburger Icon is on the left of the page when the screensize shrinks. It can easily be put back to the right, but doing so results in a previous error to occur with the last navbar element dropping down to soon when resizing.

### Tools used

* Visual Studio Code was useful due to several extensions allowing testing easier and sass auto generation.

* SASS (syntactically awesome style sheets) was used to help decouple and make logic easier to read/edit for the css.
  * They are auto-generated to normal css files that are instead added to the project. Sass is great for the editor, it's not meant for the client to see. (Resulting in somewhat confusing notes if SASS specific)
* Bootstrap was used to help with a better layout, and have it better resizable to different screen sizes.
